Images Copyright License Note
All images for app icons and logo are only for use for this 'GenieCanHelp' cancer app  as-is because this app is available to public on on apple store.
If you intend to fork this open source code to develop a new mobile app 
(as opposed to contributing to the source code of 'GeneCanHelp' app on Apple store), it is suggested that you 
create images and logo specific to your own new mobile app rather than using the images and logo provided with the source code of this app.
