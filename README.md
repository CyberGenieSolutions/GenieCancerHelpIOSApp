# GenieCancerHelpIOSApp
This project is for the IOS Application named GenieCanHelp (http://geniecanhelpapp.com/). This project on GITHub is to enable citizen developers to be able to provide voluntary contribution that is needed for on-going development of this free non-profitable application.  GenieCanHelp is a free and non-profitable app designed to support and empower patients along their cancer journey. GenieCanHelp is a refreshing change from apps that offer clinical resources and medical information. GenieCanHelp is created as a useful app to support your wellbeing and help you manage your routine. An easy-to-use app that will reduce unnecessary stress during stressful times.
